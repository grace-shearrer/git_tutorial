This tutorial was developed for a psych class at UNC Chapel Hill. It is far from exhaustive, but I do find it exhausting. I don't own any of the images, all are used under fair use for teaching. If you own the image and want it taken down please contact me. If you have updates or notes on the tutorial please open a bug request. 

All the best,

Grace
